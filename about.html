         <p>My name is Vladimir Heschia.I am 31 years old.My hometown is the located in the exact spot where the romans invaded Dacia(that's what Romania was called during that age).I've been living in Denmark for the last 4 years.I can understand Danish to a certain degree(and if they don't talk fast) and can also speak it,altough rather limited.</p>
              <p>As of summer 2017,I started studying Multimedia Design and Communication at KEA.It was an interesting experience,completely different than my own country,but also very rewarding on many levels.I am anxious to see what the other semesters have to offer and too see what other challenges await for me.</p></article>
